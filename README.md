## Project Overview ✨ 
This submission is my attempt to tackle the ABN AMRO Junior Developer Coding Challenge with a
graph visualization application. 

## Built With 🛠️

**Neo4j AuraDB (hosted on Google Cloud Platform)** ☁️

- **I used a fully managed cloud graph database service deployed on GCP for scalability, reliability, and ease of use. Neo4j's graph data model excels at storing and querying interconnected graph or tree data so I thought it would work perfectly for this coding challenge.
Moreover, AuraDB's GCP integration ensures seamless operation within the Google
Cloud ecosystem.**

**Node.js ⚙️**

- **I chose to use Node.js because it provides a robust runtime environment for the backend server,
enabling efficient data handling and communication with the database and because it is inline with ABN AMRO's tech stack**

**Express.js 💫**

- **I used it to build a RESTful API that powers
data exchange between the frontend and the Neo4j database.**

**Vanilla JavaScript 🍦**

- **I used VanillaJS as the primary programming language for consistent frontend and backend
development.**

**HTML5 🧱**

- **Structures the core content and layout of the frontend user
interface.**

**CSS 🎨**

- **Styles the visual presentation of the frontend, enhancing user
experience.**
